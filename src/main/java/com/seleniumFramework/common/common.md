It looks like you have a solid foundation for your Selenium framework with the BaseClass you provided. This class serves as the foundation for setting up WebDriver instances and managing test setup and teardown.

Here are some key points and suggestions based on the provided code:

WebDriver Management: You're using a ThreadLocal to handle WebDriver instances, which is a good practice for multi-threaded test execution. This ensures that each thread gets its own instance of the WebDriver.

Browser Setup: You're setting up Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers using WebDriverManager, which simplifies the WebDriver setup process. Consider adding support for more browsers if needed in the future.

Logging: You're using Log4j for logging, which is a popular choice. Ensure that your logging configuration (log4j2.xml or log4j.properties) is set up properly to control logging levels and output destinations.

Test Configuration: You're fetching the base URL and browser type from TestNG XML suite parameters, which allows for flexibility in configuring tests. Make sure to define these parameters appropriately in your TestNG XML suite file.

Test Setup and Teardown: The @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod annotations ensure that setup and teardown actions are performed before and after each test method execution. This helps in maintaining a clean test environment and avoids test pollution.

Exception Handling: You're catching exceptions during WebDriver teardown to ensure graceful handling of errors. Consider enhancing this by logging exceptions with appropriate error messages for better troubleshooting.

Timeout Configuration: You're configuring implicit and page load timeouts for WebDriver instances, which is essential for handling elements that may take time to load on the page.

Overall, your BaseClass provides a solid foundation for building upon your Selenium framework. As you continue developing your framework, consider adding features such as reporting, parallel execution, and data-driven testing to enhance its capabilities further.
